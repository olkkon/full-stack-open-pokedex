My team will use Delphi as it's main language for software development, since I use it on my work also. For linting in Delphi, one can use FixInsight. For unit testing there is a framework called DUnit, which we use at work also. We have modified it such that it runs automatically once a day and sends the results to mails of all developers in our company. Building is usually done using Embarcaderos integrated RAD Studio Delphi builder. This is since the language is not open source but commercial product. Therefore there isn't so many alternatives for building. Since Delphi is backwards compatible, it can be probably built with older Object Pascal builders, too.

At work we use GitLab for CI/CD. I've heard that it's better than it's GitHub counterpart, but I don't know for sure how well it competes with Jenkins.

Cloud based environment is always better than self-hosted in my opinion. Cloud based solutions are more scalable and accessable, and usually one has to pay only for raw computation time. Therefore it might be more cost-efficient to use cloud based solution compared to self-hosted server. My company uses actually self-hosted cloud servers, since we have own product and user base, thus it's better to have more flexibility in our end to offer our customers the best experience we can offer them.
